# b_cakes
This is for me (the cake decorator) to enter information of an order for one or more cakes based on the customer’s request so it can be stored electronically. I am the only “staff” so a staff table is not required. This will help me be able to create, view, update and delete orders electronically rather than using my current paper-based system.
